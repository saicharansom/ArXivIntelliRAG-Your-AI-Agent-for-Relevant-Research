      "Abstract: This paper examines the evolution, architecture, and practical applications of AI agents from their early, rule-based incarnations to modern sophisticated systems that integrate large language models with dedicated modules for perception, planning, and tool use. Emphasizing both theoretical foundations and real-world deployments, the paper reviews key agent paradigms, discusses limitations of current evaluation benchmarks, and proposes a holistic evaluation framework that balances task effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and safety. Applications across enterprise, personal assistance, and specialized domains are analyzed, with insights into future research directions for more resilient and adaptive AI agent systems.\n",
      "🔍 Summary: This paper looks at how Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents have developed over time and how they're used in different areas such as businesses, people's homes, and special industries. It discusses the strengths and weaknesses of current AI agents and proposes a new way to evaluate them that considers factors like effectiveness, efficiency, safety, and more.

      "Abstract: Traditionally, AI has been modeled within economics as a technology that impacts payoffs by reducing costs or refining information for human agents. Our position is that, in light of recent advances in generative AI, it is increasingly useful to model AI itself as an economic agent. In our framework, each user is augmented with an AI agent and can consult the AI prior to taking actions in a game. The AI agent and the user have potentially different information and preferences over the communication, which can result in equilibria that are qualitatively different than in settings without AI.\n",

      "Abstract: Continuing advances in frontier model research are paving the way for widespread deployment of AI agents. Meanwhile, global interest in building large, complex systems in software, manufacturing, energy and logistics has never been greater. Although AI driven system engineering holds tremendous promise, the static benchmarks dominating agent evaluations today fail to capture the crucial skills required for implementing dynamic systems, such as managing uncertain trade-offs and ensuring proactive adaptability. This position paper advocates for training and evaluating AI agents' system engineering abilities through automation-oriented sandbox games-particularly Factorio. By directing research efforts in this direction, we can equip AI agents with the specialized reasoning and long-horizon planning necessary to design, maintain, and optimize tomorrow's most demanding engineering projects.\n",
      "🔍 Summary: Here's a summary of the abstract in simple terms:\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers think that artificial intelligence (AI) systems are getting better and better, but they're still not good enough at handling complex problems. They want to improve AI systems so they can be used for big, complicated projects like building cars or managing supply chains. To do this, they need new ways to test and train the AI systems, and they think that playing games like Factorio could help them get better at making decisions under uncertainty.\n"
