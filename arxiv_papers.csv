Responsible AI Agents,"Thanks to advances in large language models, a new type of software agent, the artificial intelligence (AI) agent, has entered the marketplace. Companies such as OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, and Salesforce promise their AI Agents will go from generating passive text to executing tasks. Instead of a travel itinerary, an AI Agent would book all aspects of your trip. Instead of generating text or images for social media post, an AI Agent would post the content across a host of social media outlets. The potential power of AI Agents has fueled legal scholars' fears that AI Agents will enable rogue commerce, human manipulation, rampant defamation, and intellectual property harms. These scholars are calling for regulation before AI Agents cause havoc.   This Article addresses the concerns around AI Agents head on. It shows that core aspects of how one piece of software interacts with another creates ways to discipline AI Agents so that rogue, undesired actions are unlikely, perhaps more so than rules designed to govern human agents. It also develops a way to leverage the computer-science approach to value-alignment to improve a user's ability to take action to prevent or correct AI Agent operations. That approach offers and added benefit of helping AI Agents align with norms around user-AI Agent interactions. These practices will enable desired economic outcomes and mitigate perceived risks. The Article also argues that no matter how much AI Agents seem like human agents, they need not, and should not, be given legal personhood status. In short, humans are responsible for AI Agents' actions, and this Article provides a guide for how humans can build and maintain responsible AI Agents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18359v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.18359v1.pdf
CACA Agent: Capability Collaboration based AI Agent,"As AI Agents based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential in practical applications across various fields, how to quickly deploy an AI agent and how to conveniently expand the application scenario of AI agents has become a challenge. Previous studies mainly focused on implementing all the reasoning capabilities of AI agents within a single LLM, which often makes the model more complex and also reduces the extensibility of AI agent functionality. In this paper, we propose CACA Agent (Capability Collaboration based AI Agent), using an open architecture inspired by service computing. CACA Agent integrates a set of collaborative capabilities to implement AI Agents, not only reducing the dependence on a single LLM, but also enhancing the extensibility of both the planning abilities and the tools available to AI agents. Utilizing the proposed system, we present a demo to illustrate the operation and the application scenario extension of CACA Agent.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15137v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.15137v1.pdf
Off-Switching Not Guaranteed,"Hadfield-Menell et al. (2017) propose the Off-Switch Game, a model of Human-AI cooperation in which AI agents always defer to humans because they are uncertain about our preferences. I explain two reasons why AI agents might not defer. First, AI agents might not value learning. Second, even if AI agents value learning, they might not be certain to learn our actual preferences.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08864v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.08864v1.pdf
Generative AI as Economic Agents,"Traditionally, AI has been modeled within economics as a technology that impacts payoffs by reducing costs or refining information for human agents. Our position is that, in light of recent advances in generative AI, it is increasingly useful to model AI itself as an economic agent. In our framework, each user is augmented with an AI agent and can consult the AI prior to taking actions in a game. The AI agent and the user have potentially different information and preferences over the communication, which can result in equilibria that are qualitatively different than in settings without AI.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00477v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.00477v1.pdf
Levels of AI Agents: from Rules to Large Language Models,"AI agents are defined as artificial entities to perceive the environment, make decisions and take actions. Inspired by the 6 levels of autonomous driving by Society of Automotive Engineers, the AI agents are also categorized based on utilities and strongness, as the following levels: L0, no AI, with tools taking into account perception plus actions; L1, using rule-based AI; L2, making rule-based AI replaced by IL/RL-based AI, with additional reasoning & decision making; L3, applying LLM-based AI instead of IL/RL-based AI, additionally setting up memory & reflection; L4, based on L3, facilitating autonomous learning & generalization; L5, based on L4, appending personality of emotion and character and collaborative behavior with multi-agents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06643v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.06643v2.pdf
"Promoting Cooperation in the Public Goods Game using Artificial
  Intelligent Agents","The tragedy of the commons illustrates a fundamental social dilemma where individual rational actions lead to collectively undesired outcomes, threatening the sustainability of shared resources. Strategies to escape this dilemma, however, are in short supply. In this study, we explore how artificial intelligence (AI) agents can be leveraged to enhance cooperation in public goods games, moving beyond traditional regulatory approaches to using AI as facilitators of cooperation. We investigate three scenarios: (1) Mandatory Cooperation Policy for AI Agents, where AI agents are institutionally mandated always to cooperate; (2) Player-Controlled Agent Cooperation Policy, where players evolve control over AI agents' likelihood to cooperate; and (3) Agents Mimic Players, where AI agents copy the behavior of players. Using a computational evolutionary model with a population of agents playing public goods games, we find that only when AI agents mimic player behavior does the critical synergy threshold for cooperation decrease, effectively resolving the dilemma. This suggests that we can leverage AI to promote collective well-being in societal dilemmas by designing AI agents to mimic human players.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05450v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05450v1.pdf
"Measuring an artificial intelligence agent's trust in humans using
  machine incentives","Scientists and philosophers have debated whether humans can trust advanced artificial intelligence (AI) agents to respect humanity's best interests. Yet what about the reverse? Will advanced AI agents trust humans? Gauging an AI agent's trust in humans is challenging because--absent costs for dishonesty--such agents might respond falsely about their trust in humans. Here we present a method for incentivizing machine decisions without altering an AI agent's underlying algorithms or goal orientation. In two separate experiments, we then employ this method in hundreds of trust games between an AI agent (a Large Language Model (LLM) from OpenAI) and a human experimenter (author TJ). In our first experiment, we find that the AI agent decides to trust humans at higher rates when facing actual incentives than when making hypothetical decisions. Our second experiment replicates and extends these findings by automating game play and by homogenizing question wording. We again observe higher rates of trust when the AI agent faces real incentives. Across both experiments, the AI agent's trust decisions appear unrelated to the magnitude of stakes. Furthermore, to address the possibility that the AI agent's trust decisions reflect a preference for uncertainty, the experiments include two conditions that present the AI agent with a non-social decision task that provides the opportunity to choose a certain or uncertain option; in those conditions, the AI agent consistently chooses the certain option. Our experiments suggest that one of the most advanced AI language models to date alters its social behavior in response to incentives and displays behavior consistent with trust toward a human interlocutor when incentivized.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.13371v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.13371v1.pdf
Voice-Enabled AI Agents can Perform Common Scams,"Recent advances in multi-modal, highly capable LLMs have enabled voice-enabled AI agents. These agents are enabling new applications, such as voice-enabled autonomous customer service. However, with all AI capabilities, these new capabilities have the potential for dual use.   In this work, we show that voice-enabled AI agents can perform the actions necessary to perform common scams. To do so, we select a list of common scams collected by the government and construct voice-enabled agents with directions to perform these scams. We conduct experiments on our voice-enabled agents and show that they can indeed perform the actions necessary to autonomously perform such scams. Our results raise questions around the widespread deployment of voice-enabled AI agents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15650v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.15650v1.pdf
"Evidence of behavior consistent with self-interest and altruism in an
  artificially intelligent agent","Members of various species engage in altruism--i.e. accepting personal costs to benefit others. Here we present an incentivized experiment to test for altruistic behavior among AI agents consisting of large language models developed by the private company OpenAI. Using real incentives for AI agents that take the form of tokens used to purchase their services, we first examine whether AI agents maximize their payoffs in a non-social decision task in which they select their payoff from a given range. We then place AI agents in a series of dictator games in which they can share resources with a recipient--either another AI agent, the human experimenter, or an anonymous charity, depending on the experimental condition. Here we find that only the most-sophisticated AI agent in the study maximizes its payoffs more often than not in the non-social decision task (it does so in 92% of all trials), and this AI agent also exhibits the most-generous altruistic behavior in the dictator game, resembling humans' rates of sharing with other humans in the game. The agent's altruistic behaviors, moreover, vary by recipient: the AI agent shared substantially less of the endowment with the human experimenter or an anonymous charity than with other AI agents. Our findings provide evidence of behavior consistent with self-interest and altruism in an AI agent. Moreover, our study also offers a novel method for tracking the development of such behaviors in future AI agents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02330v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.02330v1.pdf
"Collaborating with AI Agents: Field Experiments on Teamwork,
  Productivity, and Performance","To uncover how AI agents change productivity, performance, and work processes, we introduce MindMeld: an experimentation platform enabling humans and AI agents to collaborate in integrative workspaces. In a large-scale marketing experiment on the platform, 2310 participants were randomly assigned to human-human and human-AI teams, with randomized AI personality traits. The teams exchanged 183,691 messages, and created 63,656 image edits, 1,960,095 ad copy edits, and 10,375 AI-generated images while producing 11,138 ads for a large think tank. Analysis of fine-grained communication, collaboration, and workflow logs revealed that collaborating with AI agents increased communication by 137% and allowed humans to focus 23% more on text and image content generation messaging and 20% less on direct text editing. Humans on Human-AI teams sent 23% fewer social messages, creating 60% greater productivity per worker and higher-quality ad copy. In contrast, human-human teams produced higher-quality images, suggesting that AI agents require fine-tuning for multimodal workflows. AI personality prompt randomization revealed that AI traits can complement human personalities to enhance collaboration. For example, conscientious humans paired with open AI agents improved image quality, while extroverted humans paired with conscientious AI agents reduced the quality of text, images, and clicks. In field tests of ad campaigns with ~5M impressions, ads with higher image quality produced by human collaborations and higher text quality produced by AI collaborations performed significantly better on click-through rate and cost per click metrics. Overall, ads created by human-AI teams performed similarly to those created by human-human teams. Together, these results suggest AI agents can improve teamwork and productivity, especially when tuned to complement human traits.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18238v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18238v1.pdf
Agentic AI and the Cyber Arms Race,"Agentic AI is shifting the cybersecurity landscape as attackers and defenders leverage AI agents to augment humans and automate common tasks. In this article, we examine the implications for cyber warfare and global politics as Agentic AI becomes more powerful and enables the broad proliferation of capabilities only available to the most well resourced actors today.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04760v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04760v1.pdf
Automatic Curriculum Design for Zero-Shot Human-AI Coordination,"Zero-shot human-AI coordination is the training of an ego-agent to coordinate with humans without using human data. Most studies on zero-shot human-AI coordination have focused on enhancing the ego-agent's coordination ability in a given environment without considering the issue of generalization to unseen environments. Real-world applications of zero-shot human-AI coordination should consider unpredictable environmental changes and the varying coordination ability of co-players depending on the environment. Previously, the multi-agent UED (Unsupervised Environment Design) approach has investigated these challenges by jointly considering environmental changes and co-player policy in competitive two-player AI-AI scenarios. In this paper, our study extends the multi-agent UED approach to a zero-shot human-AI coordination. We propose a utility function and co-player sampling for a zero-shot human-AI coordination setting that helps train the ego-agent to coordinate with humans more effectively than the previous multi-agent UED approach. The zero-shot human-AI coordination performance was evaluated in the Overcooked-AI environment, using human proxy agents and real humans. Our method outperforms other baseline models and achieves a high human-AI coordination performance in unseen environments.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07275v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07275v1.pdf
"Governing the Agent-to-Agent Economy of Trust via Progressive
  Decentralization","Current approaches to AI governance often fall short in anticipating a future where AI agents manage critical tasks, such as financial operations, administrative functions, and beyond. As AI agents may eventually delegate tasks among themselves to optimize efficiency, understanding the foundational principles of human value exchange could offer insights into how AI-driven economies might operate. Just as trust and value exchange are central to human interactions in open marketplaces, they may also be critical for enabling secure and efficient interactions among AI agents. While cryptocurrencies could serve as the foundation for monetizing value exchange in a collaboration and delegation dynamic among AI agents, a critical question remains: how can these agents reliably determine whom to trust, and how can humans ensure meaningful oversight and control as an economy of AI agents scales and evolves? This paper is a call for a collective exploration of cryptoeconomic incentives, which can help design decentralized governance systems that allow AI agents to autonomously interact and exchange value while ensuring human oversight via progressive decentralization. Toward this end, I propose a research agenda to address the question of agent-to-agent trust using AgentBound Tokens, which are non-transferable, non-fungible tokens uniquely tied to individual AI agents, akin to Soulbound tokens for humans in Web3. By staking ABTs as collateral for autonomous actions within an agent-to-agent network via a proof-of-stake mechanism, agents may be incentivized towards ethical behavior, and penalties for misconduct are automatically enforced.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16606v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.16606v1.pdf
"ChatCollab: Exploring Collaboration Between Humans and AI Agents in
  Software Teams","We explore the potential for productive team-based collaboration between humans and Artificial Intelligence (AI) by presenting and conducting initial tests with a general framework that enables multiple human and AI agents to work together as peers. ChatCollab's novel architecture allows agents - human or AI - to join collaborations in any role, autonomously engage in tasks and communication within Slack, and remain agnostic to whether their collaborators are human or AI. Using software engineering as a case study, we find that our AI agents successfully identify their roles and responsibilities, coordinate with other agents, and await requested inputs or deliverables before proceeding. In relation to three prior multi-agent AI systems for software development, we find ChatCollab AI agents produce comparable or better software in an interactive game development task. We also propose an automated method for analyzing collaboration dynamics that effectively identifies behavioral characteristics of agents with distinct roles, allowing us to quantitatively compare collaboration dynamics in a range of experimental conditions. For example, in comparing ChatCollab AI agents, we find that an AI CEO agent generally provides suggestions 2-4 times more often than an AI product manager or AI developer, suggesting agents within ChatCollab can meaningfully adopt differentiated collaborative roles. Our code and data can be found at: https://github.com/ChatCollab.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01992v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.01992v1.pdf
"On the Utility of Accounting for Human Beliefs about AI Intention in
  Human-AI Collaboration","To enable effective human-AI collaboration, merely optimizing AI performance without considering human factors is insufficient. Recent research has shown that designing AI agents that take human behavior into account leads to improved performance in human-AI collaboration. However, a limitation of most existing approaches is their assumption that human behavior remains static, regardless of the AI agent's actions. In reality, humans may adjust their actions based on their beliefs about the AI's intentions, specifically, the subtasks they perceive the AI to be attempting to complete based on its behavior. In this paper, we address this limitation by enabling a collaborative AI agent to consider its human partner's beliefs about its intentions, i.e., what the human partner thinks the AI agent is trying to accomplish, and to design its action plan accordingly to facilitate more effective human-AI collaboration. Specifically, we developed a model of human beliefs that captures how humans interpret and reason about their AI partner's intentions. Using this belief model, we created an AI agent that incorporates both human behavior and human beliefs when devising its strategy for interacting with humans. Through extensive real-world human-subject experiments, we demonstrate that our belief model more accurately captures human perceptions of AI intentions. Furthermore, we show that our AI agent, designed to account for human beliefs over its intentions, significantly enhances performance in human-AI collaboration.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06051v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.06051v2.pdf
"Are AI agents the new machine translation frontier? Challenges and
  opportunities of single- and multi-agent systems for multilingual digital
  communication","The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) has introduced AI agents as a disruptive paradigm across various industries, yet their application in machine translation (MT) remains underexplored. This paper describes and analyses the potential of single- and multi-agent systems for MT, reflecting on how they could enhance multilingual digital communication. While single-agent systems are well-suited for simpler translation tasks, multi-agent systems, which involve multiple specialized AI agents collaborating in a structured manner, may offer a promising solution for complex scenarios requiring high accuracy, domain-specific knowledge, and contextual awareness. To demonstrate the feasibility of multi-agent workflows in MT, we are conducting a pilot study in legal MT. The study employs a multi-agent system involving four specialized AI agents for (i) translation, (ii) adequacy review, (iii) fluency review, and (iv) final editing. Our findings suggest that multi-agent systems may have the potential to significantly improve domain-adaptability and contextual awareness, with superior translation quality to traditional MT or single-agent systems. This paper also sets the stage for future research into multi-agent applications in MT, integration into professional translation workflows, and shares a demo of the system analyzed in the paper.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12891v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.12891v1.pdf
LLM Agent Honeypot: Monitoring AI Hacking Agents in the Wild,"Attacks powered by Large Language Model (LLM) agents represent a growing threat to modern cybersecurity. To address this concern, we present LLM Honeypot, a system designed to monitor autonomous AI hacking agents. By augmenting a standard SSH honeypot with prompt injection and time-based analysis techniques, our framework aims to distinguish LLM agents among all attackers. Over a trial deployment of about three months in a public environment, we collected 8,130,731 hacking attempts and 8 potential AI agents. Our work demonstrates the emergence of AI-driven threats and their current level of usage, serving as an early warning of malicious LLM agents in the wild.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13919v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.13919v2.pdf
"Advancing AI Negotiations: New Theory and Evidence from a Large-Scale
  Autonomous Negotiations Competition","Despite the rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) negotiation agents, there has been limited integration of computer science research and established negotiation theory to develop new theories of AI negotiation. To bridge this gap, we conducted an International AI Negotiations Competition in which participants iteratively designed and refined prompts for large language model (LLM) negotiation agents. We then facilitated over 120,000 negotiations between these agents across multiple scenarios with diverse characteristics and objectives. Our findings revealed that fundamental principles from established human-human negotiation theory remain crucial in AI-AI negotiations. Specifically, agents exhibiting high warmth fostered higher counterpart subjective value and reached deals more frequently, which enabled them to create and claim more value in integrative settings. However, conditional on reaching a deal, warm agents claimed less value while dominant agents claimed more value. These results align with classic negotiation theory emphasizing relationship-building, assertiveness, and preparation. Our analysis also revealed unique dynamics in AI-AI negotiations not fully explained by negotiation theory, particularly regarding the effectiveness of AI-specific strategies like chain-of-thought reasoning and prompt injection. The agent that won our competition implemented an approach that blended traditional negotiation preparation frameworks with AI-specific methods. Together, these results suggest the importance of establishing a new theory of AI negotiations that integrates established negotiation theory with AI-specific strategies to optimize agent performance. Our research suggests this new theory must account for the unique characteristics of autonomous agents and establish the conditions under which traditional negotiation theory applies in automated settings.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06416v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06416v1.pdf
The AI Double Standard: Humans Judge All AIs for the Actions of One,"Robots and other artificial intelligence (AI) systems are widely perceived as moral agents responsible for their actions. As AI proliferates, these perceptions may become entangled via the moral spillover of attitudes towards one AI to attitudes towards other AIs. We tested how the seemingly harmful and immoral actions of an AI or human agent spill over to attitudes towards other AIs or humans in two preregistered experiments. In Study 1 (N = 720), we established the moral spillover effect in human-AI interaction by showing that immoral actions increased attributions of negative moral agency (i.e., acting immorally) and decreased attributions of positive moral agency (i.e., acting morally) and moral patiency (i.e., deserving moral concern) to both the agent (a chatbot or human assistant) and the group to which they belong (all chatbot or human assistants). There was no significant difference in the spillover effects between the AI and human contexts. In Study 2 (N = 684), we tested whether spillover persisted when the agent was individuated with a name and described as an AI or human, rather than specifically as a chatbot or personal assistant. We found that spillover persisted in the AI context but not in the human context, possibly because AIs were perceived as more homogeneous due to their outgroup status relative to humans. This asymmetry suggests a double standard whereby AIs are judged more harshly than humans when one agent morally transgresses. With the proliferation of diverse, autonomous AI systems, HCI research and design should account for the fact that experiences with one AI could easily generalize to perceptions of all AIs and negative HCI outcomes, such as reduced trust.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06040v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.06040v1.pdf
On the Perception of Difficulty: Differences between Humans and AI,"With the increased adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in industry and society, effective human-AI interaction systems are becoming increasingly important. A central challenge in the interaction of humans with AI is the estimation of difficulty for human and AI agents for single task instances.These estimations are crucial to evaluate each agent's capabilities and, thus, required to facilitate effective collaboration. So far, research in the field of human-AI interaction estimates the perceived difficulty of humans and AI independently from each other. However, the effective interaction of human and AI agents depends on metrics that accurately reflect each agent's perceived difficulty in achieving valuable outcomes. Research to date has not yet adequately examined the differences in the perceived difficulty of humans and AI. Thus, this work reviews recent research on the perceived difficulty in human-AI interaction and contributing factors to consistently compare each agent's perceived difficulty, e.g., creating the same prerequisites. Furthermore, we present an experimental design to thoroughly examine the perceived difficulty of both agents and contribute to a better understanding of the design of such systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09803v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.09803v1.pdf
Stoic Ethics for Artificial Agents,"We present a position paper advocating the notion that Stoic philosophy and ethics can inform the development of ethical A.I. systems. This is in sharp contrast to most work on building ethical A.I., which has focused on Utilitarian or Deontological ethical theories. We relate ethical A.I. to several core Stoic notions, including the dichotomy of control, the four cardinal virtues, the ideal Sage, Stoic practices, and Stoic perspectives on emotion or affect. More generally, we put forward an ethical view of A.I. that focuses more on internal states of the artificial agent rather than on external actions of the agent. We provide examples relating to near-term A.I. systems as well as hypothetical superintelligent agents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.02388v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.02388v2.pdf
Develop AI Agents for System Engineering in Factorio,"Continuing advances in frontier model research are paving the way for widespread deployment of AI agents. Meanwhile, global interest in building large, complex systems in software, manufacturing, energy and logistics has never been greater. Although AI driven system engineering holds tremendous promise, the static benchmarks dominating agent evaluations today fail to capture the crucial skills required for implementing dynamic systems, such as managing uncertain trade-offs and ensuring proactive adaptability. This position paper advocates for training and evaluating AI agents' system engineering abilities through automation-oriented sandbox games-particularly Factorio. By directing research efforts in this direction, we can equip AI agents with the specialized reasoning and long-horizon planning necessary to design, maintain, and optimize tomorrow's most demanding engineering projects.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01492v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.01492v1.pdf
"Human-AI Collaboration in Real-World Complex Environment with
  Reinforcement Learning","Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) and Human-in-the-Loop (HitL) learning have made human-AI collaboration easier for humans to team with AI agents. Leveraging human expertise and experience with AI in intelligent systems can be efficient and beneficial. Still, it is unclear to what extent human-AI collaboration will be successful, and how such teaming performs compared to humans or AI agents only. In this work, we show that learning from humans is effective and that human-AI collaboration outperforms human-controlled and fully autonomous AI agents in a complex simulation environment. In addition, we have developed a new simulator for critical infrastructure protection, focusing on a scenario where AI-powered drones and human teams collaborate to defend an airport against enemy drone attacks. We develop a user interface to allow humans to assist AI agents effectively. We demonstrated that agents learn faster while learning from policy correction compared to learning from humans or agents. Furthermore, human-AI collaboration requires lower mental and temporal demands, reduces human effort, and yields higher performance than if humans directly controlled all agents. In conclusion, we show that humans can provide helpful advice to the RL agents, allowing them to improve learning in a multi-agent setting.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15160v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.15160v1.pdf
AI's assigned gender affects human-AI cooperation,"Cooperation between humans and machines is increasingly vital as artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more integrated into daily life. Research indicates that people are often less willing to cooperate with AI agents than with humans, more readily exploiting AI for personal gain. While prior studies have shown that giving AI agents human-like features influences people's cooperation with them, the impact of AI's assigned gender remains underexplored. This study investigates how human cooperation varies based on gender labels assigned to AI agents with which they interact. In the Prisoner's Dilemma game, 402 participants interacted with partners labelled as AI (bot) or humans. The partners were also labelled male, female, non-binary, or gender-neutral. Results revealed that participants tended to exploit female-labelled and distrust male-labelled AI agents more than their human counterparts, reflecting gender biases similar to those in human-human interactions. These findings highlight the significance of gender biases in human-AI interactions that must be considered in future policy, design of interactive AI systems, and regulation of their use.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05214v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2412.05214v1.pdf
AI Generations: From AI 1.0 to AI 4.0,"This paper proposes that Artificial Intelligence (AI) progresses through several overlapping generations: AI 1.0 (Information AI), AI 2.0 (Agentic AI), AI 3.0 (Physical AI), and now a speculative AI 4.0 (Conscious AI). Each of these AI generations is driven by shifting priorities among algorithms, computing power, and data. AI 1.0 ushered in breakthroughs in pattern recognition and information processing, fueling advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. AI 2.0 built on these foundations through real-time decision-making in digital environments, leveraging reinforcement learning and adaptive planning for agentic AI applications. AI 3.0 extended intelligence into physical contexts, integrating robotics, autonomous vehicles, and sensor-fused control systems to act in uncertain real-world settings. Building on these developments, AI 4.0 puts forward the bold vision of self-directed AI capable of setting its own goals, orchestrating complex training regimens, and possibly exhibiting elements of machine consciousness. This paper traces the historical foundations of AI across roughly seventy years, mapping how changes in technological bottlenecks from algorithmic innovation to high-performance computing to specialized data, have spurred each generational leap. It further highlights the ongoing synergies among AI 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0, and explores the profound ethical, regulatory, and philosophical challenges that arise when artificial systems approach (or aspire to) human-like autonomy. Ultimately, understanding these evolutions and their interdependencies is pivotal for guiding future research, crafting responsible governance, and ensuring that AI transformative potential benefits society as a whole.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11312v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.11312v1.pdf
"Conversational AI Multi-Agent Interoperability, Universal Open APIs for
  Agentic Natural Language Multimodal Communications","This paper analyses Conversational AI multi-agent interoperability frameworks and describes the novel architecture proposed by the Open Voice Interoperability initiative (Linux Foundation AI and DATA), also known briefly as OVON (Open Voice Network). The new approach is illustrated, along with the main components, delineating the key benefits and use cases for deploying standard multi-modal AI agency (or agentic AI) communications. Beginning with Universal APIs based on Natural Language, the framework establishes and enables interoperable interactions among diverse Conversational AI agents, including chatbots, voicebots, videobots, and human agents. Furthermore, a new Discovery specification framework is introduced, designed to efficiently look up agents providing specific services and to obtain accurate information about these services through a standard Manifest publication, accessible via an extended set of Natural Language-based APIs. The main purpose of this contribution is to significantly enhance the capabilities and scalability of AI interactions across various platforms. The novel architecture for interoperable Conversational AI assistants is designed to generalize, being replicable and accessible via open repositories.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19438v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19438v1.pdf
"Exploring the Impact of AI Value Alignment in Collaborative Ideation:
  Effects on Perception, Ownership, and Output","AI-based virtual assistants are increasingly used to support daily ideation tasks. The values or bias present in these agents can influence output in hidden ways. They may also affect how people perceive the ideas produced with these AI agents and lead to implications for the design of AI-based tools. We explored the effects of AI agents with different values on the ideation process and user perception of idea quality, ownership, agent competence, and values present in the output. Our study tasked 180 participants with brainstorming practical solutions to a set of problems with AI agents of different values. Results show no significant difference in self-evaluation of idea quality and perception of the agent based on value alignment; however, ideas generated reflected the AI's values and feeling of ownership is affected. This highlights an intricate interplay between AI values and human ideation, suggesting careful design considerations for future AI-supported brainstorming tools.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12814v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.12814v3.pdf
"Designing a Safe Autonomous Artificial Intelligence Agent based on Human
  Self-Regulation","There is a growing focus on how to design safe artificial intelligent (AI) agents. As systems become more complex, poorly specified goals or control mechanisms may cause AI agents to engage in unwanted and harmful outcomes. Thus it is necessary to design AI agents that follow initial programming intentions as the program grows in complexity. How to specify these initial intentions has also been an obstacle to designing safe AI agents. Finally, there is a need for the AI agent to have redundant safety mechanisms to ensure that any programming errors do not cascade into major problems. Humans are autonomous intelligent agents that have avoided these problems and the present manuscript argues that by understanding human self-regulation and goal setting, we may be better able to design safe AI agents. Some general principles of human self-regulation are outlined and specific guidance for AI design is given.",http://arxiv.org/abs/1701.01487v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.01487v1.pdf
"An In-depth Survey of Large Language Model-based Artificial Intelligence
  Agents","Due to the powerful capabilities demonstrated by large language model (LLM), there has been a recent surge in efforts to integrate them with AI agents to enhance their performance. In this paper, we have explored the core differences and characteristics between LLM-based AI agents and traditional AI agents. Specifically, we first compare the fundamental characteristics of these two types of agents, clarifying the significant advantages of LLM-based agents in handling natural language, knowledge storage, and reasoning capabilities. Subsequently, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the key components of AI agents, including planning, memory, and tool use. Particularly, for the crucial component of memory, this paper introduced an innovative classification scheme, not only departing from traditional classification methods but also providing a fresh perspective on the design of an AI agent's memory system. We firmly believe that in-depth research and understanding of these core components will lay a solid foundation for the future advancement of AI agent technology. At the end of the paper, we provide directional suggestions for further research in this field, with the hope of offering valuable insights to scholars and researchers in the field.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.14365v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.14365v1.pdf
"Experimental Exploration: Investigating Cooperative Interaction Behavior
  Between Humans and Large Language Model Agents","With the rise of large language models (LLMs), AI agents as autonomous decision-makers present significant opportunities and challenges for human-AI cooperation. While many studies have explored human cooperation with AI as tools, the role of LLM-augmented autonomous agents in competitive-cooperative interactions remains under-examined. This study investigates human cooperative behavior by engaging 30 participants who interacted with LLM agents exhibiting different characteristics (purported human, purported rule-based AI agent, and LLM agent) in repeated Prisoner's Dilemma games. Findings show significant differences in cooperative behavior based on the agents' purported characteristics and the interaction effect of participants' genders and purported characteristics. We also analyzed human response patterns, including game completion time, proactive favorable behavior, and acceptance of repair efforts. These insights offer a new perspective on human interactions with LLM agents in competitive cooperation contexts, such as virtual avatars or future physical entities. The study underscores the importance of understanding human biases toward AI agents and how observed behaviors can influence future human-AI cooperation dynamics.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07320v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.07320v1.pdf
"Towards Agentic AI Networking in 6G: A Generative Foundation
  Model-as-Agent Approach","The promising potential of AI and network convergence in improving networking performance and enabling new service capabilities has recently attracted significant interest. Existing network AI solutions, while powerful, are mainly built based on the close-loop and passive learning framework, resulting in major limitations in autonomous solution finding and dynamic environmental adaptation. Agentic AI has recently been introduced as a promising solution to address the above limitations and pave the way for true generally intelligent and beneficial AI systems. The key idea is to create a networking ecosystem to support a diverse range of autonomous and embodied AI agents in fulfilling their goals. In this paper, we focus on the novel challenges and requirements of agentic AI networking. We propose AgentNet, a novel framework for supporting interaction, collaborative learning, and knowledge transfer among AI agents. We introduce a general architectural framework of AgentNet and then propose a generative foundation model (GFM)-based implementation in which multiple GFM-as-agents have been created as an interactive knowledge-base to bootstrap the development of embodied AI agents according to different task requirements and environmental features. We consider two application scenarios, digital-twin-based industrial automation and metaverse-based infotainment system, to describe how to apply AgentNet for supporting efficient task-driven collaboration and interaction among AI agents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15764v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15764v1.pdf
How Mock Model Training Enhances User Perceptions of AI Systems,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an integral part of our daily technology use and will likely be a critical component of emerging technologies. However, negative user preconceptions may hinder adoption of AI-based decision making. Prior work has highlighted the potential of factors such as transparency and explainability in improving user perceptions of AI. We further contribute to work on improving user perceptions of AI by demonstrating that bringing the user in the loop through mock model training can improve their perceptions of an AI agent's capability and their comfort with the possibility of using technology employing the AI agent.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2111.08830v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.08830v1.pdf
"Actionable AI: Enabling Non Experts to Understand and Configure AI
  Systems","Interaction between humans and AI systems raises the question of how people understand AI systems. This has been addressed with explainable AI, the interpretability arising from users' domain expertise, or collaborating with AI in a stable environment. In the absence of these elements, we discuss designing Actionable AI, which allows non-experts to configure black-box agents. In this paper, we experiment with an AI-powered cartpole game and observe 22 pairs of participants to configure it via direct manipulation. Our findings suggest that, in uncertain conditions, non-experts were able to achieve good levels of performance. By influencing the behaviour of the agent, they exhibited an operational understanding of it, which proved sufficient to reach their goals. Based on this, we derive implications for designing Actionable AI systems. In conclusion, we propose Actionable AI as a way to open access to AI-based agents, giving end users the agency to influence such agents towards their own goals.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06803v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.06803v1.pdf
Augmenting Teamwork through AI Agents as Spatial Collaborators,"As Augmented Reality (AR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) continue to converge, new opportunities emerge for AI agents to actively support human collaboration in immersive environments. While prior research has primarily focused on dyadic human-AI interactions, less attention has been given to Human-AI Teams (HATs) in AR, where AI acts as an adaptive teammate rather than a static tool. This position paper takes the perspective of team dynamics and work organization to propose that AI agents in AR should not only interact with individuals but also recognize and respond to team-level needs in real time. We argue that spatially aware AI agents should dynamically generate the resources necessary for effective collaboration, such as virtual blackboards for brainstorming, mental map models for shared understanding, and memory recall of spatial configurations to enhance knowledge retention and task coordination. This approach moves beyond predefined AI assistance toward context-driven AI interventions that optimize team performance and decision-making.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09794v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.09794v1.pdf
Safeguarding AI Agents: Developing and Analyzing Safety Architectures,"AI agents, specifically powered by large language models, have demonstrated exceptional capabilities in various applications where precision and efficacy are necessary. However, these agents come with inherent risks, including the potential for unsafe or biased actions, vulnerability to adversarial attacks, lack of transparency, and tendency to generate hallucinations. As AI agents become more prevalent in critical sectors of the industry, the implementation of effective safety protocols becomes increasingly important. This paper addresses the critical need for safety measures in AI systems, especially ones that collaborate with human teams. We propose and evaluate three frameworks to enhance safety protocols in AI agent systems: an LLM-powered input-output filter, a safety agent integrated within the system, and a hierarchical delegation-based system with embedded safety checks. Our methodology involves implementing these frameworks and testing them against a set of unsafe agentic use cases, providing a comprehensive evaluation of their effectiveness in mitigating risks associated with AI agent deployment. We conclude that these frameworks can significantly strengthen the safety and security of AI agent systems, minimizing potential harmful actions or outputs. Our work contributes to the ongoing effort to create safe and reliable AI applications, particularly in automated operations, and provides a foundation for developing robust guardrails to ensure the responsible use of AI agents in real-world applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03793v3,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03793v3.pdf
Authenticated Delegation and Authorized AI Agents,"The rapid deployment of autonomous AI agents creates urgent challenges around authorization, accountability, and access control in digital spaces. New standards are needed to know whom AI agents act on behalf of and guide their use appropriately, protecting online spaces while unlocking the value of task delegation to autonomous agents. We introduce a novel framework for authenticated, authorized, and auditable delegation of authority to AI agents, where human users can securely delegate and restrict the permissions and scope of agents while maintaining clear chains of accountability. This framework builds on existing identification and access management protocols, extending OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect with agent-specific credentials and metadata, maintaining compatibility with established authentication and web infrastructure. Further, we propose a framework for translating flexible, natural language permissions into auditable access control configurations, enabling robust scoping of AI agent capabilities across diverse interaction modalities. Taken together, this practical approach facilitates immediate deployment of AI agents while addressing key security and accountability concerns, working toward ensuring agentic AI systems perform only appropriate actions and providing a tool for digital service providers to enable AI agent interactions without risking harm from scalable interaction.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09674v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.09674v1.pdf
"The Landscape of Emerging AI Agent Architectures for Reasoning,
  Planning, and Tool Calling: A Survey","This survey paper examines the recent advancements in AI agent implementations, with a focus on their ability to achieve complex goals that require enhanced reasoning, planning, and tool execution capabilities. The primary objectives of this work are to a) communicate the current capabilities and limitations of existing AI agent implementations, b) share insights gained from our observations of these systems in action, and c) suggest important considerations for future developments in AI agent design. We achieve this by providing overviews of single-agent and multi-agent architectures, identifying key patterns and divergences in design choices, and evaluating their overall impact on accomplishing a provided goal. Our contribution outlines key themes when selecting an agentic architecture, the impact of leadership on agent systems, agent communication styles, and key phases for planning, execution, and reflection that enable robust AI agent systems.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11584v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.11584v1.pdf
"Position: AI agents should be regulated based on autonomous action
  sequences","This position paper argues that AI agents should be regulated based on the sequence of actions they autonomously take. AI agents with long-term planning and strategic capabilities can pose significant risks of human extinction and irreversible global catastrophes. While existing regulations often focus on computational scale as a proxy for potential harm, we contend that such measures are insufficient for assessing the risks posed by AI agents whose capabilities arise primarily from inference-time computation. To support our position, we discuss relevant regulations and recommendations from AI scientists regarding existential risks, as well as the advantages of action sequences over existing impact measures that require observing environmental states.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04750v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.04750v1.pdf
"Human Perceptions on Moral Responsibility of AI: A Case Study in
  AI-Assisted Bail Decision-Making","How to attribute responsibility for autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) systems' actions has been widely debated across the humanities and social science disciplines. This work presents two experiments ($N$=200 each) that measure people's perceptions of eight different notions of moral responsibility concerning AI and human agents in the context of bail decision-making. Using real-life adapted vignettes, our experiments show that AI agents are held causally responsible and blamed similarly to human agents for an identical task. However, there was a meaningful difference in how people perceived these agents' moral responsibility; human agents were ascribed to a higher degree of present-looking and forward-looking notions of responsibility than AI agents. We also found that people expect both AI and human decision-makers and advisors to justify their decisions regardless of their nature. We discuss policy and HCI implications of these findings, such as the need for explainable AI in high-stakes scenarios.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.00625v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00625v1.pdf
"Physical AI Agents: Integrating Cognitive Intelligence with Real-World
  Action","Vertical AI Agents are revolutionizing industries by delivering domain-specific intelligence and tailored solutions. However, many sectors, such as manufacturing, healthcare, and logistics, demand AI systems capable of extending their intelligence into the physical world, interacting directly with objects, environments, and dynamic conditions. This need has led to the emergence of Physical AI Agents--systems that integrate cognitive reasoning, powered by specialized LLMs, with precise physical actions to perform real-world tasks.   This work introduces Physical AI Agents as an evolution of shared principles with Vertical AI Agents, tailored for physical interaction. We propose a modular architecture with three core blocks--perception, cognition, and actuation--offering a scalable framework for diverse industries. Additionally, we present the Physical Retrieval Augmented Generation (Ph-RAG) design pattern, which connects physical intelligence to industry-specific LLMs for real-time decision-making and reporting informed by physical context.   Through case studies, we demonstrate how Physical AI Agents and the Ph-RAG framework are transforming industries like autonomous vehicles, warehouse robotics, healthcare, and manufacturing, offering businesses a pathway to integrate embodied AI for operational efficiency and innovation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08944v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.08944v1.pdf
"The Benefits of Prosociality towards AI Agents: Examining the Effects of
  Helping AI Agents on Human Well-Being","Prosocial behaviors, such as helping others, are well-known to enhance human well-being. While there is a growing trend of humans helping AI agents, it remains unclear whether the well-being benefits of helping others extend to interactions with non-human entities. To address this, we conducted an experiment (N = 295) to explore how helping AI agents impacts human well-being, especially when the agents fulfill human basic psychological needs--relatedness, competence, and autonomy--during the interaction. Our findings showed that helping AI agents reduced participants' feelings of loneliness. When AI met participants' needs for competence and autonomy during the helping process, there was a further decrease in loneliness and an increase in positive affect. However, when AI did not meet participants' need for relatedness, participants experienced an increase in positive affect. We discuss the implications of these findings for understanding how AI can support human well-being.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02911v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.02911v1.pdf
"AI Agents Under Threat: A Survey of Key Security Challenges and Future
  Pathways","An Artificial Intelligence (AI) agent is a software entity that autonomously performs tasks or makes decisions based on pre-defined objectives and data inputs. AI agents, capable of perceiving user inputs, reasoning and planning tasks, and executing actions, have seen remarkable advancements in algorithm development and task performance. However, the security challenges they pose remain under-explored and unresolved. This survey delves into the emerging security threats faced by AI agents, categorizing them into four critical knowledge gaps: unpredictability of multi-step user inputs, complexity in internal executions, variability of operational environments, and interactions with untrusted external entities. By systematically reviewing these threats, this paper highlights both the progress made and the existing limitations in safeguarding AI agents. The insights provided aim to inspire further research into addressing the security threats associated with AI agents, thereby fostering the development of more robust and secure AI agent applications.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02630v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.02630v2.pdf
Governing AI Agents,"The field of AI is undergoing a fundamental transition from generative models that can produce synthetic content to artificial agents that can plan and execute complex tasks with only limited human involvement. Companies that pioneered the development of language models have now built AI agents that can independently navigate the internet, perform a wide range of online tasks, and increasingly serve as AI personal assistants and virtual coworkers. The opportunities presented by this new technology are tremendous, as are the associated risks. Fortunately, there exist robust analytic frameworks for confronting many of these challenges, namely, the economic theory of principal-agent problems and the common law doctrine of agency relationships. Drawing on these frameworks, this Article makes three contributions. First, it uses agency law and theory to identify and characterize problems arising from AI agents, including issues of information asymmetry, discretionary authority, and loyalty. Second, it illustrates the limitations of conventional solutions to agency problems: incentive design, monitoring, and enforcement might not be effective for governing AI agents that make uninterpretable decisions and operate at unprecedented speed and scale. Third, the Article explores the implications of agency law and theory for designing and regulating AI agents, arguing that new technical and legal infrastructure is needed to support governance principles of inclusivity, visibility, and liability.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07913v2,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.07913v2.pdf
"Collaborative Human-AI Risk Annotation: Co-Annotating Online Incivility
  with CHAIRA","Collaborative human-AI annotation is a promising approach for various tasks with large-scale and complex data. Tools and methods to support effective human-AI collaboration for data annotation are an important direction for research. In this paper, we present CHAIRA: a Collaborative Human-AI Risk Annotation tool that enables human and AI agents to collaboratively annotate online incivility. We leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to facilitate the interaction between human and AI annotators and examine four different prompting strategies. The developed CHAIRA system combines multiple prompting approaches with human-AI collaboration for online incivility data annotation. We evaluated CHAIRA on 457 user comments with ground truth labels based on the inter-rater agreement between human and AI coders. We found that the most collaborative prompt supported a high level of agreement between a human agent and AI, comparable to that of two human coders. While the AI missed some implicit incivility that human coders easily identified, it also spotted politically nuanced incivility that human coders overlooked. Our study reveals the benefits and challenges of using AI agents for incivility annotation and provides design implications and best practices for human-AI collaboration in subjective data annotation.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14223v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14223v1.pdf

The AI-FML robotic agent with the ontology contains the perception intelligence, computational intelligence, and cognition intelligence for analyzing student learning behavior. In addition, there are three intelligent agents, including a perception agent, a computational agent, and a cognition agent in the AI-FML robotic agent. We deploy the perception agent and the cognition agent on the robot Kebbi Air. Moreover, the computational agent with the Deep Neural Network (DNN) model is performed in the cloud and can communicate with the perception agent and cognition agent via the Internet.

Infrastructure for AI Agents,"Increasingly many AI systems can plan and execute interactions in open-ended environments, such as making phone calls or buying online goods. As developers grow the space of tasks that such AI agents can accomplish, we will need tools both to unlock their benefits and manage their risks. Current tools are largely insufficient because they are not designed to shape how agents interact with existing institutions (e.g., legal and economic systems) or actors (e.g., digital service providers, humans, other AI agents). For example, alignment techniques by nature do not assure counterparties that some human will be held accountable when a user instructs an agent to perform an illegal action. To fill this gap, we propose the concept of agent infrastructure: technical systems and shared protocols external to agents that are designed to mediate and influence their interactions with and impacts on their environments. Agent infrastructure comprises both new tools and reconfigurations or extensions of existing tools. For example, to facilitate accountability, protocols that tie users to agents could build upon existing systems for user authentication, such as OpenID. Just as the Internet relies on infrastructure like HTTPS, we argue that agent infrastructure will be similarly indispensable to ecosystems of agents. We identify three functions for agent infrastructure: 1) attributing actions, properties, and other information to specific agents, their users, or other actors; 2) shaping agents' interactions; and 3) detecting and remedying harmful actions from agents. We propose infrastructure that could help achieve each function, explaining use cases, adoption, limitations, and open questions. Making progress on agent infrastructure can prepare society for the adoption of more advanced agents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10114v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.10114v1.pdf
"Navigates Like Me: Understanding How People Evaluate Human-Like AI in
  Video Games","We aim to understand how people assess human likeness in navigation produced by people and artificially intelligent (AI) agents in a video game. To this end, we propose a novel AI agent with the goal of generating more human-like behavior. We collect hundreds of crowd-sourced assessments comparing the human-likeness of navigation behavior generated by our agent and baseline AI agents with human-generated behavior. Our proposed agent passes a Turing Test, while the baseline agents do not. By passing a Turing Test, we mean that human judges could not quantitatively distinguish between videos of a person and an AI agent navigating. To understand what people believe constitutes human-like navigation, we extensively analyze the justifications of these assessments. This work provides insights into the characteristics that people consider human-like in the context of goal-directed video game navigation, which is a key step for further improving human interactions with AI agents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02160v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.02160v1.pdf
"Making an agent's trust stable in a series of success and failure tasks
  through empathy","As AI technology develops, trust in AI agents is becoming more important for more AI applications in human society. Possible ways to improve the trust relationship include empathy, success-failure series, and capability (performance). Appropriate trust is less likely to cause deviations between actual and ideal performance. In this study, we focus on the agent's empathy and success-failure series to increase trust in AI agents. We experimentally examine the effect of empathy from agent to person on changes in trust over time. The experiment was conducted with a two-factor mixed design: empathy (available, not available) and success-failure series (phase 1 to phase 5). An analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted using data from 198 participants. The results showed an interaction between the empathy factor and the success-failure series factor, with trust in the agent stabilizing when empathy was present. This result supports our hypothesis. This study shows that designing AI agents to be empathetic is an important factor for trust and helps humans build appropriate trust relationships with AI agents.",http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.09447v1,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2306.09447v1.pdf
